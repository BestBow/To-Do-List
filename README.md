# To-Do List Application

## Overview
The **To-Do List Application** is a simple task management system built using Java. It allows users to create, manage, and track their daily tasks efficiently. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, remove tasks, and view their task list. The application includes file persistence, ensuring that tasks are saved to a file (`tasks.txt`) and reloaded when the program restarts.

## Features
- **Add Tasks** – Users can add new tasks with a description.
- **View Tasks** – Displays all tasks with their status (Pending/Completed).
- **Mark Tasks as Completed** – Allows users to mark tasks as done.
- **Remove Tasks** – Users can delete tasks by ID.
- **File Persistence** – Tasks are saved to a file and reloaded on startup.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** – Core programming language
- **File Handling (I/O)** – Saves and loads tasks from a file

## Installation and Usage
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (JDK 8 or later)
- A Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) or a terminal

### Steps to Run the Application
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
